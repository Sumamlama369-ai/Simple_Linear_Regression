# 📈 Simple Linear Regression – From Concept to Implementation

This repository contains my hands-on learning and implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** using Python and scikit-learn. It includes step-by-step training and evaluation of a linear model, written in Jupyter Notebooks.


## 🧠 What I Learned

- The core idea behind **Simple Linear Regression**
- How to fit a line to data using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`
- Understanding key concepts:
  - **Independent vs. Dependent Variables**
  - **Model Coefficients & Intercept**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R-squared (R²) Score**
  - **Visualization of fit and errors**
